# External-Mergesort
CS315 Assignment

## Usage
To compile, run the following command:
```
./script.sh
```
or
```
g++ mergesort.cpp -o mergesort
```
Then, a executable will be created with name `mergesort`.
Follow the instructions given in `mergesort.pdf` to run this executable.
eg:
```
.\mergesort input.txt 33 4 20 3
```
Finally, all the details about the simulation (like `cost` and `output` at each phase) will be printed onto the terminal and the sorted output will be written into a new file named `sorted_output.txt`.
